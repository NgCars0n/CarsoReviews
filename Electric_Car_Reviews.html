                <p>I feel that the bz4x is marketed as a car that can replace your daily driver. The bz4x provides all the features you need for daily life, while bringing in some new excitement due to the quickness, and new technology associated with electric vehicles. The bz4x comes in two trim levels, XLE, and Limited.” </p>

                height="400">
                <p>The ford F-150 is a huge step for the electric truck market. The industry has yet to have one of the big truck manufacturers come out with a completely electric truck. I think Ford is taking a great step with this new model, to showcase what a future with electric trucks could look like. The Ford F-150 lightning has 4 trim levels pro, XLT, Lariat, and platinum.”  </p>

                <p>The Bolt EV has been awarded the best electric car for 2023 by U.S. News & World Report. From what I have seen the Bolt looks high tech, with a decent interior. It Hes in all the features that you want out of an electric car, while being budget friendly. It comes in two trim levels, 1LT, and 2LT</p>
